Ad-hoc activities can be created and follow up for a given case.

Activities are dynamic in nature, and even within a given case-type there are different
activities applicable. This app allows you to register activities for a given
zaak reference.

Eventually, the data/API should be moved into a standalone API, which is probably
going to be the (generic) objects API.
