The ZAC represents the application of the 5th layer of the Common Ground architecture. It
requests and modifies information from different APIs including Zaken API, Documenten API,
Kownsl API, etc. Therefore the ZAC has implemented the authorization model which ensures that
all the ZAC users have permission to perform necessary operations via these APIs.
