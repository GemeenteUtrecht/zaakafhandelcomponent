Forms in objecttypes
====================

In order to start a camunda process for a ZAAK usually camunda requires specific data.
To streamline this process we use :ref:`Camunda Process Forms <StartCamundaProcessForm>`.
This form needs to be filled in before the business process can start.

Please refer to the documentation on :ref:`Camunda Process Forms <StartCamundaProcessForm>` on how
to create more forms and please refer the OBJECTS API for current specific forms.
