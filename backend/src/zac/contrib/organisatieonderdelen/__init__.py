Application to store the "Organisatie onderdelen" which defines the structure of the
municipality.

These entities are related to zaken as "betrokkene". They serve an authorization check
function.

In the future, a dedicated API will exist to expose these entities following the
Organisatorische Eenheid RGBZ model. Until that solution exists, we must use a
temporary solution as described by the document "Grenzen van het API landschap" in the
VNG standard documentation.
